# LeagueDash

LeagueDash is a desktop application built to assist in organizing a recreational soccer league including team formation,
game scheduling, and calculating the league standings in real time.

There are three types of users in LeagueDash:

1. Players
1. Captains, and
1. The Commissioner (only one)

Players have the fewest affordances and can create a profile and view league details. Captains can create, edit and delete a team and add or remove players. In addition, Captains can update the final score to games their team played in. Finally, the Commissioner has the highest authorization level and can schedule games in addition to removing teams from the league or players from a team's roster.

LeagueDash is built using MVC architecture with .NET Entity Framework and customized Razor Templates for UI. Styling is with Bootstrap and the Google Maps API is utilized to display a game's location on a map within the app.
